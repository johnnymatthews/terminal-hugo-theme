# Terminal Hugo Theme

---

This repo is a **work in progress**. Use at your own risk.

---

A dirty, kinda ugly, terminal-based theme for the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/). This theme is based on my [Terminal Portfolio](https://github.com/mohnjatthews/terminal-portfolio). Make your blog post look like something out of the 1970! Kinda. This theme is mobile friendly by default, and includes a readbility-function thanks to [Mblode's Marx Classless CSS](https://github.com/mblode/marx). It also utilizes [Meyerweb's Reset.css](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) and [Int10h's IBM Terminal Font](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/).
