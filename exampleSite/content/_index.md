## About

I'm not so good with the advice. Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? So, uh, what did the insurance company say? Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here so stop calling us." Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life. I wish I could help you but I don't want to. Uh, uh, we'll flip for it, ducks or clowns. Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby? You got a better idea? All right, call it in the air. Heads. Heads it is. Yess! Whoo! We have to assign heads to something! Right, okay, okay, uhhh, ducks is heads, because ducks...have heads. What kinda' scary-ass clowns came to your birthday!? Rules are good, rules control the fun! Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman. And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition. Paper...snow.....a ghost!!!

## Contact

I was so focused on being mad at you, I forgot what it was I was mad about. Hey, Ross, I got a science question: If the homo sapiens were, in fact, HOMO sapiens...is that why they're extinct? Joey, homo sapiens are PEOPLE. Hey, I'm not judgin'! You just said a bunch of stuff I don't know. Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman. And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition. So basically you get your ya-yas from taking money from all of your friends? Yeah. Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less, so... Sure I peed on her. And if I had to, I'd pee on any one of you! Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil? Yeah, I definitely don't like the name Ross. What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
