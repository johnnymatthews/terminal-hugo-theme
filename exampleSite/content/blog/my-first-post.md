## I Love Writing

15 Yemen Road, Yemen. Hey, Mon, look, I'm melting butter. That's great, Rach. You now have the cooking skills of a hot day. So basically you get your ya-yas from taking money from all of your friends? Yeah. Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less, so... He may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat. Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-alike contest and WON! Ross came fourth and CRIED! It's a moo point. It's like a cow's opinion; it doesn't matter. It's moo. Well, the fridge broke and I had to eat everything. Rules are good, rules control the fun!

Je m'appelle Claude All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers... it doesn't make much of a difference. I'm curvy and I like it. Hey, just so you know: it's NOT that common, it DOESN'T happen to every guy, and it IS a big deal! One really does have a stick up one's ass. Doesn't one? I'm not great at the advice. Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? You know how you come home at the end of the day and throw your jacket on a chair? Yeah. Well, instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time and garbage is all that has survived. Sure I peed on her. And if I had to, I'd pee on any one of you!

### Man this is Weird

You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat? I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants! And remember, If I'm harsh with you, it's only because you're doing it wrong. Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper. I can hear the voices in my head again. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian. Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise they don't let you do it. You think that's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years. No I worked in a Dairy Queen.

## Someone Ate

The only good thing going on in my life. You know how you come home at the end of the day and throw your jacket on a chair? Yeah. Well, instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time and garbage is all that has survived. Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-alike contest and WON! Ross came fourth and CRIED! Hey, you know what I just realized? ‘Joker' is ‘poker' with a ‘J'. Coincidence? Hey, that's ‘joincidence' with a ‘C'. We would like some more alcohol. You know what else? We would like some more beers. Getting over you was the hardest thing I ever had to do, and I never let myself thing about you. Hey, Ross, I got a science question: If the homo sapiens were, in fact, HOMO sapiens...is that why they're extinct? Joey, homo sapiens are PEOPLE. Hey, I'm not judgin'! Je m'appelle Claude

Oh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress? You could not be any more wrong. You could try, but you would not be successful. He may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat. Suppose we're a divorced couple. Okay. And I got custody of the kid, right? Now, suppose the kid dies and I gotta buy a new kid. Hey, just so you know: it's NOT that common, it DOESN'T happen to every guy, and it IS a big deal! WHOOOPAH! All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers... it doesn't make much of a difference. It's a moo point. It's like a cow's opinion; it doesn't matter. It's moo.
