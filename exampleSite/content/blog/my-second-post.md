## Normally

It sounds like you're asking me out on a man date. I'm sorry, that was my mistake, I keep forgetting that you're a horrible, horrible person. Would you please get off my ex-wife? Because nothing sucks worse than feeling alone, no matter how many people are around. Well... dammit! Gosh, now I'm too proud of you to be mad at you. You've always known about my sleep toots. Hell, you used to imitate the sound they made, remember? Yeah, I have to throw up first. Time to take the GR off my Gratitude and give that old bastard some Attitude, J.D. style.

Yeah, I have to throw up first. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present, Man Not Caring. Why do you have to jump out and scare me all the time?

You only call me Christopher when you're mad or when we're having sex... Baby, are you mad when we're having sex? Sorry Snoop Dogg Resident. Laverne believes in God which is hilarious to me and Ted is the hospital sad sack.

Normally you would hear crickets but they were uncomfortable about just how unfunny that was. I'm sorry, that was my mistake, I keep forgetting that you're a horrible, horrible person.

I'm not angry. So my girlfriend serviced most of the staff? I'm proud of her commitment to medicine. Christopher? You only call me Christopher when you're mad or when we're having sex... Baby, are you mad when we're having sex? Why do you have to jump out and scare me all the time?

Well isn't that just the pickle on the giant crap sandwich that is my day. Well... dammit! Gosh, now I'm too proud of you to be mad at you. Hm! Can't believe Chuck gave up stripping to become a city councilman! Laverne, I wrote the guest list for this conversation, and just in case, if you're wondering, you're not on it!
